### Description

Letter Drop is a game where letters drop (duh ;) and you must (or else...) arrange them to create words. The words can be formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You can also muck around with some settings. (Cool font included.)

** The game is 100% working, but not 100% polished, please, please tell me what I need to fix, I love feedback. **
