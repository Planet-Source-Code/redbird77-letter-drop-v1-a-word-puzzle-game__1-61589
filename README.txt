[ABOUT]
Letter Drop is a game where letters drop (duh ;) and you must (or else...) arrange them to create words.  The words can be formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  You can also muck around with some settings.

Use the arrow keys to move the block.  See if you can find the cheat (and the cheat to the cheat ;)

Letter Drop features include:
- high score list
- looping midi background music
- additional game play sound effects
- pretty colors
- highly commented source
